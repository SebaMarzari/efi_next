This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Create .env file with access to firebase:
```

JWT_KEY="secret key of JWToken"
NODE_ENV=environment to be worked in

CONTAINER_NAME=Name of our container

DB_NAME=Database name
DB_USER=Postgres user
DB_HOST=Host where the database is going to be run
DB_DRIVER=Dialect of postgres
DB_PASSWORD=Postgres password 
DB_PORT=Port on which our postgres environment is going to run

```

Before starting the project, run the ```make up``` command to raise our doker container.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
